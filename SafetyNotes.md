## Laser Safety ##
Lasers are classified to describe the capabilities of a laser system to produce injury to people. This classification rates from 'Class I' lasers to 'Class IV' lasers. Read the [laser safety guide](http://ehs.uky.edu/radiation/laser_fs.html) for details.

Lasers, even the low-powered once, are dangerous - they can cause a permanent damage to vision if pointed towards people's faces or eyes. Additionally careful attention needs to be payed to mirrored surfaces, lenses and other optical apparatus that can send laser light off in unexpected directions or increase its power to a damaging degree.

Therefore make sure that

  * you are using 'Class I' low-powered red-light lasers only,
  * the laser-optics, that widen the laser point to a line, is in place and working,
  * you buy only approved lasers that come with a safety sticker including the laser Class,
  * you never point the laser into the direction of other people,
  * you remove any shiny or light-focusing parts before using the laser,
  * you and people around you wear laser safety glasses that prevent the laser light from hitting your retina.
